# EZBorrow App

This application aims to reduce the human physical presence for accomplishing simple but time-consuming tasks, by developing an application that contains two interfaces. 

One for the users who can search for the books they want to buy, plus they can view the due date for the books they borrowed, along with these the borrowed history will be present on the user interface. 

Another interface will be of the librarian, who can see the list of books currently available, he will be able to modify the database with the options of adding new books or changing the book's versions, deleting a few when needed, he will be able to see the data about the number of people borrowed which book and in what quantity. There will be a penalty on the users who won't deposit the borrowed books on time, i.e. by the due date.
